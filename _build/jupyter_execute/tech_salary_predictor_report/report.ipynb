    "## Introduction\n",
    "Graduates and seasoned tech employees may have a question about how much they should get paid from their employers for the reason that salary is never transparent information. Lack of enough information, graduates may feel lost and insecure and job seekers may be at disadvantage when having salary discussion with HR. Hence, we come up with this idea to build up a model to predict the pay that technicians can expect based on several explicit factors including education level, previous experience, location etc."

    "## Methods\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data set used in this project is sourced from the survey, [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), which is conducted annually with nearly 80000 responses from different backgrounds. Based on the survey results {cite:p}`stack_overflow_survey`, much useful features could be extracted such as education level, location, the language used, job type, all of which are potentially associated with the annual compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "After performing EDA on the training data set, there several points worth mention. The distribution of the response variable, salary, is positive skewed with a fat tail, as shown in Fig. 1 {cite:p}`vanderplas2018altair`. This attribute is undesirable, which makes the model less robust. So, extremely high salary (top 8%) in our training data set will be defined as outliers which are removed in the preprocessing step.<br>\n",

    "Among all the features investigated, it can be found that the salary is strongly correlated to the number of professional coding years. Fig.2 clearly shows that there is a linear relation between the number of professional coding years and the salary.\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "In light of EDA and recommendations from Stack Overflow, 4 features are extracted that are duration for being a profession, education level, programming language worked with and job position. Then, the regression equation can be obtained:<br>\n",

    "$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "*where w is the weight vector, X is the feature vector, b is the error term, $Y_{salary}$ is predicted variable.* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the training data set, randomized hyperparameter searching {cite:p}`scikit-learn` was also carried out based on the scoring matrix, $R^2$."
